                        This is what is considered a cult film from the middle of the Nineties during the period of lots of indie films, following the same style as Dazed and Confused and Clerks. But is it truly any good? Well let's find out....

                        Another classic from the eighties that if you believe the rumours is just waiting to be ruined by a remake. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a perfect family rollercoaster of an adventure which is throw back to classic adventure serials. But how well does it hold up after over thirty years? Let's find out....

                        Ah Ghostbusters… these will always be a favourite of mine so I’m going to always be a little biased. I remember seeing this film in the cinema and loving every minute of it. But I was only 10 years old. Does it still hold up now? I would say yes, but maybe not so much when compared to the original...

                <p>Kevin Smith’s third film could be considered critically the best film he has ever made.

                  Here we go with another reboot of Spider-Man. Everything is redone and recast, whether it is a good or bad thing. This version came out in 2012, about five years after Spier-Man 3 came out, and in many people’s eyes destroyed the franchise....

                  <p>
                  This is a film that stars some of the classic actors of a golden age of cinema that were capable of doing just about anything. The film is entertaining, albeit long though. It has a humour that everyone can enjoy, from sophisticated wit to silly slapstick humour. This could be one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen....

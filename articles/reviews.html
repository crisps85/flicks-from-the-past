		<h4>Little Shop of Horrors</h4>

		<p>Ah Ghostbusters… these will always be a favourite of mine so I’m going to always be a little biased. I remember seeing this film in the cinema and loving every minute of it. But I was only 10 years old. Does it still hold up now? I would say yes, but maybe not so much when compared to the original...

		<p>Here we go with another reboot of Spider-Man. Everything is redone and recast, whether it is a good or bad thing. This version came out in 2012, about five years after Spier-Man 3 came out, and in many people’s eyes destroyed the franchise....

		<h4>Spider-Man (2002)</h4>
		<p>Well this I would say is an insanely good super hero comic book movie. It covers everything that you would expect from a Spider-Man film. Web slinging action, excellent set pieces and a good old fashioned baddy, although I would have preferred Doc Ock....

		<h4>The Great Race</h4>
		<p>This is a film that stars some of the classic actors of a golden age of cinema that were capable of doing just about anything. The film is entertaining, albeit long though.
